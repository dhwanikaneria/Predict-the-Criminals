There has been a surge in crimes committed in recent years, making crime a top cause of concern for law enforcement. If we are able to estimate whether someone is going to commit a crime in the future, we can take precautions and be prepared. You are given a dataset containing answers to various questions concerning the professional and private lives of several people. A few of them have been arrested for various small and large crimes in the past. Use the given data to predict if the people in the test data will commit a crime. The train data consists of 45718 rows, while the test data consists of 11430 rows.
